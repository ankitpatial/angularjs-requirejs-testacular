Sample Project for AngularJS with require.js and Testacular
==============================

After digging through the internet for a couples of days, searching for a valid resource of a project using AngularJS with
require.js and a running Testacular configuration, I finally decided to build and submit this project. I struggeld some days,
until I found this highly useful blog article (http://entwicklertagebuch.com/blog/2013/01/angularjs-app-mit-requirejs-und-testacular-testen/#comment-83),
which helped me a lot to understand core issues with my source. 

Finally after a couple of chats, Marco showed me the reasons why my intial project setup did not work out of the box. Thanks
a lot!
